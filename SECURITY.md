# Security Configuration

## Environment Variables Security

### ✅ Secure Implementation

This project correctly implements security best practices:

1. **Environment Variables** - Kept separate for different services

   - Frontend variables in: `.env`

### 🔒 Security Measures

- ✅ All sensitive information is kept in environment files
- ✅ Environment files are not committed to version control
- ✅ Proper separation of configurations

### ⚠️ Important Security Notes

1. **NEVER commit .env files** to version control
2. **Always use environment templates** for safe setup
3. **Restart services** after updating environment files
